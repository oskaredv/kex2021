  <p>Thank you for testing out our system! Now we need you to take this survey about your experience with the system: <a href="https://forms.gle/muCaLvukS5s71ne56">https://forms.gle/muCaLvukS5s71ne56</a></p>
  <p>
    Welcome to our degree project study. 
    In this study we need your help to test our question-authoring system over the course of <b><u>one week</u></b>. 
    During this week we need you to write and submit at least 5 questions about <b><u>introductory Computer Science</u></b>. 
    These questions will then be reviewed by professors at KTH and potentially used as practice questions in 
    introductory level courses. We recommend that you try to write one question a day to make the workload easily managed. 
    The study will end on <b><u>May 4th 2021</u></b>. After that we will send out a survey where you will be asked about your experience with the system.
  </p>

  <h5>Points and Badges</h5>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Points</b>: As a reward for submitting questions you will earn points</li>
    <li><b>Streak</b>: If you submit questions several days in a row you will get a streak</li>
    <li><b>Streak point boost</b>: While having an active streak you will get more points for submitting a question</li>
    <li><b>Badges</b>: You can also earn badges for submitting certain amounts of questions or for maintaining a streak</li>
  </ul>

  <p>To view your points and badges, head over to your profile page! </p>
